# Basic Operations in Python

# Arithmetic operations with numbers
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Adds a and b
print(a * b)  # Multiplies a and b
print(a / b)  # Divides a by b (result is float)
print(a % b)  # Finds the remainder

# String concatenation and repetition
first_name = "Upendra"
last_name = "Singhai"
print(first_name + " " + last_name)  # Concatenates strings


print("-" * 3)  # Repeats the string 3 times

# Mixing types (with proper conversions)
age = 100
print("Upendra's Age:"+ str(age))  # Converts age to a string for concatenation


# Simple input and output
user_input = input("What's your name?")
print("Hello, ", user_input)

# EXERCISE
# Ask for birth year
# Show age
# BONUS: Ask for the user's name and age, then display: "Hey [name]! You are [age] years old."
